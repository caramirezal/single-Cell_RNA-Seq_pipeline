# single-Cell RNA-Seq workflow

The goal of this repository is to implement pipeline to analyze a RNA Single Cell Seq data from the [Illumina Bio-Rad ddSEQ single Cell Isolator](https://info.bio-rad.com/ww-ddseq.html?WT.mc_id=170714020570&WT.srch=1&WT.knsh_id=e50cb18e-db41-4521-9913-bfda8e0a1e87). An open tutorial written by Vladimir Kiselev on genomic format processing regarding RNA Single Seq data can be found [here](https://hemberg-lab.github.io/scRNA.seq.course/figures/flowchart.png), the following image is taken from that source.

The RNA Single Cell Data used to implement this pipeline consists of pair ended sequences from murine mESC cells publicly available [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-2600/samples/). See the full documentation of this workflow [here](https://github.com/caramirezal/single-Cell_RNA-Seq_pipeline/wiki).
